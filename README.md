# nifties-vs-nfties - NIFTY remote hack

*Should we call ERC-721 tokens Nifties or Nfties? You decide by crafting monsters with or without eyes.*

I'm not able to attend the [NIFTY hackathon in Hong Kong](https://www.nifty.gg/), but I love to **#BUIDL** with NFTs so I decided to take the day off work to make a fun little project based around this poll about üëÅÔ∏è's in Nifties:

![the great poll begins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/master/public/thegreatpoll.png)

Other than the rule about physically being there, I will follow all of their [hackathon rules posted here](https://niftyhacks.devpost.com/rules) and do my best to document my process.

----

### 9:30 AM - Create React App

To prepare the repo with the correct directory structure, I'll use **create react app** to kick off the #BUIDL:

```
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties
cd nifties-vs-nfties
npx create-react-app .
npm i
```


### 10:00 AM - Uploaded Assets

I created the **Nifties** vs **Nfties** monsters by drawing each different piece in a different layer in Photoshop. Then, I exported each layer using [this tool](https://github.com/jwa107/Photoshop-Export-Layers-to-Files-Fast). Finally, I built [a node script](https://gist.github.com/austintgriffith/e79373979f8d47b23656464942668177) that composes all the different layers in all the different combinations to produce the static assets.

Each token consists of a different head, body, mouth, feet, etc... I wanted to make them static assets and not dynamically generate them each time. This allows me to upload them to IPFS or a similar service and not have any traditional backend.

Here is an example token *nfties-5-4-5-3-5.png* (body 5, feet 4, head 5, mouth 3, extra 5):

![nfties-5-4-5-3-5.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/master/public/tokens/nfties-5-4-5-3-5.png)

*Note: these files are too big. I already started the upload because I'm moving fast on this, but I will want to do a second pass and shrink these to about 25% their current size.*

### 10:45 AM - Carve out service worker & clean up CRA

One of the first things I do when building a Dapp is carve out the service worker from [index.js](https://github.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/blob/master/src/index.js) because of issues you end up having down the road with web3, ssl, and android:
https://medium.com/coinmonks/react-service-worker-web3-android-98970a6691ad

I also like to strip CRA down to just the basics and get a little cleaner [App.css](https://github.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/blob/master/src/App.css) file ready. Plus getting the favicon looking right and add in the SEO junk.

### 10:50 AM - Clevis & Zeppelin

I have my own blockchain orchestration tool called **Clevis** that is similar to Truffle. Building it helped me understand a lot of the underlying mechanics work so I stick to using it instead of switching to Truffle, but they can work harmoniously together if needed. Learn more about clevis here: https://github.com/austintgriffith/clevis

```
clevis init
```

We are also going to need OpenZeppelin's wonderful library of contracts to extend:

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity.git
```

### 12:10 PM - Write Nifties and Nfties Smart Contracts

The smart contracts will be fairly simple. We will want to extend the fantastic work by **OpenZeppelin** to create our own ERC-721s with metadata for the different parts of the NFT monsters:

```
struct Token{
  uint8 body;
  uint8 feet;
  uint8 head;
  uint8 mouth;
  uint8 extra;
  uint64 birthBlock;
}
```

I'll also be reusing some old code from my game https://galleass.io to pull uint8 random numbers from the blockhash:

```
bytes32 sudoRandomButTotallyPredictable = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(totalSupply(),blockhash(block.number - 1)));
uint8 body = (uint8(sudoRandomButTotallyPredictable[0])%5)+1;
uint8 feet = (uint8(sudoRandomButTotallyPredictable[1])%5)+1;
uint8 head = (uint8(sudoRandomButTotallyPredictable[2])%5)+1;
uint8 mouth = (uint8(sudoRandomButTotallyPredictable[3])%5)+1;
uint8 extra = (uint8(sudoRandomButTotallyPredictable[4])%5)+1;
```

Obviously, if this was somehow tied to real money it would be a very bad idea to generate randomness on-chian. I wrote an article that explains that more here: https://medium.com/coinmonks/is-block-blockhash-block-number-1-okay-14a28e40cc4b

It will take me a bit to write these smart contracts. I'll used **Clevis** to create, compile, deploy, and publish these contracts into my app after firing up a local testrpc:

```
ganache-cli
clevis create Nfties
clevis compile Nfties
clevis deploy Nfties 0
clevis create Nifties
clevis compile Nifties
clevis deploy Nifties 0
clevis test publish
```

All of this can be run with a single clevis command too:

```
clevis test full
```

Once the contracts are deployed to my local testnet, I can test that the create function works by calling create as account 1:

```
clevis contract create Nifties 1
```

Then, I can call get for the token with id 0:

```
clevis contract get Nifties 0
```

Neat, this returns the metadata for the monster and it looks like it did the random number generation correctly:

```
Result {
  '0': '0x173A937400860b7CdAB63c1d462B05B8426f6991',
  '1': '5',
  '2': '2',
  '3': '7',
  '4': '7',
  '5': '10',
  owner: '0x173A937400860b7CdAB63c1d462B05B8426f6991',
  body: '5',
  feet: '2',
  head: '7',
  mouth: '7',
  birthBlock: '10'
}
```

Let's also look to see that the token's URI is correct because this was the headiest part of the contract (and most gas inefficient, Solidity pros will laugh when they see my code):

```
clevis contract tokenURI Nifties 0
```

returns:

```
https://nifties.io/tokens/nifties-5-2-7-7.png
```
At this point, the above website is not up yet, but it will be by the end of this hack! Here is what that monster looks like:

![nifties-5-2-7-7.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/master/public/tokens/nifties-5-2-7-7.png)

My contracts use about 45% of all the gas just to do the string concat... it's pretty dirty, but it's a fast and loose hackathon day!

I'll do the same tests for the Nfties contract and then get the code pushed out:

```
clevis contract create NFties 2
clevis contract get Nfties 0
```

It looks good. Damn, these really came together quickly. Big thanks to OpenZeppelin and the contributors to those well curated contracts. We stand on some pretty impressive shoulders :)

Hacking these contracts up quickly reminded me of whailing away on the contracts for my game **Cryptogs.io** in the hotel room at **#EthDenver**. Here is one of the more interesting commits from that night: https://github.com/austintgriffith/cryptogs/commit/4cada47cbb18a8a27221b10b38ccb98ad80f5006

### 12:45 PM - Dapparat.us: Metamask

After participating in a few hackathons and building out a couple blockchain games, I found that I was reusing a lot of the same React components... everything from the simple account display to event parsing to transactions UI/UX.

I wouldn't be able to build this project out so quickly without my NPM package called [Dapparatus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dapparatus). There will also, no doubt, be some commits to this repo throughout the day too. It is evolving quickly:
https://github.com/austintgriffith/dapparatus

Let's bring in the **dapparatus** package and start building out our frontend to talk to our contracts:

```
npm install --save dapparatus
```

In the **App.js** I'll bring in all the **Dapparatus** components:

```
import { Metamask, Gas, ContractLoader, Transactions, Events, Scaler } from "dapparatus"
```

The **Metamask** object is the first and most important. It watches for the injected web3 provider and ships updates to your main app as blocks, balances, etc change:

```
<Metamask
  onUpdate={(state)=>{
    console.log("metamask state update:",state)
    if(state.web3Provider) {
      state.web3 = new Web3(state.web3Provider)
      this.setState(state)
    }
  }}
/>
```

![metamask.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/master/public/metamask.gif)


This component is also the most configurable and all the options can be found here: https://github.com/austintgriffith/dapparatus/blob/master/src/metamask.js

### 1:30 PM - Dapparat.us: Gas, ContractLoader, Transactions, Events

I'll breeze through the rest of the components as I add them into the **App.js**.  

**Gas** used to be a slider, but gas sliders are so Q1 2018 ü§£. I pulled the slider interface out and now I count on the [ethgasstation api](https://ethgasstation.info/json/ethgasAPI.json) to get the gas just right every time.

```
<Gas
  onUpdate={(state)=>{
    console.log("Gas price update:",state)
    this.setState(state,()=>{
      console.log("GWEI set:",this.state)
    })
  }}
/>
```

This will keep our app up-to-date with current gas prices and even apply a small multiplier to make sure our transactions will go through quickly:

```
Gas price update: {gwei: 3.21}
```

The **Transactions** component gives us a nice UI down in the corner that shows the blocks being loaded and our transactions with the blockchain:

```
<Transactions
  account={account}
  gwei={gwei}
  web3={web3}
  block={block}
  avgBlockTime={avgBlockTime}
  etherscan={etherscan}
  onReady={(state)=>{
    console.log("Transactions component is ready:",state)
    this.setState(state)
  }}
/>
```

![blockloader.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/master/public/blockloader.gif)

The **ContractLoader** uses the files published by **Clevis** to prepare an interface with the contracts.

```
<ContractLoader
  config={{hide:false}}
  web3={web3}
  require={path => {return require(`${__dirname}/${path}`)}}
  onReady={(contracts)=>{
    console.log("contracts loaded",contracts)
    this.setState({contracts:contracts})
  }}
/>
```

At first I leave the hide:false so I can see the contracts come in right on the page:

![public/contractscreen.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/master/public/contractscreen.png)

The **Events** component is used to follow events from contracts. I will use this to keep a long list of each token created from either contract. I could also use it to list the current user's using a **filter** object, but I'll actually just poll the contract for that later.

```
<Events
  contract={contracts.Nifties}
  eventName={"Create"}
  block={block}
  id={"_id"}
  onUpdate={(eventData,allEvents)=>{
    console.log("EVENT DATA:",eventData)
    this.setState({events:allEvents})
  }}
/>
<Events
  contract={contracts.Nfties}
  eventName={"Create"}
  block={block}
  id={"_id"}
  onUpdate={(eventData,allEvents)=>{
    console.log("EVENT DATA:",eventData)
    this.setState({events:allEvents})
  }}
/>
```

Awesome. Time for more ‚òï

### 2:30 PM - Mock out the design in React & the Dapparat.us Scaler

Starting with the title image, I will wrap most of my UI with a **Scaler** from the **Dapparatus** library. After building a few blockchain games that must look good on both a desktop machine and mobile wallet like **Trust**, you quickly realized it's a huge pain to make your Dapp responsive. That's where the **Scaler** component comes in. Basically, you can control sizing depending on the screen size dynamically.

```
<div style={{width:"100%",height:160,backgroundColor:"#282828"}}>
  <Scaler config={{origin:"50px 50px",adjustedZoom:1.3}}>
    <img style={{position:"absolute",left:10,top:10,maxHeight:120,margin:10}} src="niftiesvsnfties.png"/>
  </Scaler>
</div>
```

![screenscale.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/master/public/screenscale.gif)

The vision I have for the app is that it will be hosted on both nifties.io and nfties.io and depending on what domain you are coming in on you get that respective UI. Nifties.io will mean you are in the yes-eye-in-nifities camp. I'm going to mock out this design first and then build it to be responsive later.

There will be two different calls-to-action; the main one will be to "Feed The Nifties" which will trigger a transaction to the Nifities smart contract and create a new Niftie in your inventory. However, if you think maybe you want to be in the no-eye-in-nfties camp, there is a second button that will take you to nfties.io where you can "Feed The Nfties".

Next I'm going to use a **StackGrid** (https://github.com/tsuyoshiwada/react-stack-grid) to split the page into two columns and then a nested **StackGrid** for each set up monsters. This will make it look really nice on both desktop and mobile browsers.

```
npm install --save react-stack-grid
```

```
<StackGrid columnWidth={"50%"}>
  <div key="key1" className={"col"}>{leftCol}</div>
  <div key="key2" className={"col"}>{rightCol}</div>
</StackGrid>
```

Each column is then mocked up with a **Scaler** for the button:

```
<div>
  <Scaler config={{origin:"center top",adjustedZoom:1.4}}>
    <img src="feedthenifties.png" style={bigButtonStyle}/>
  </Scaler>
  <StackGrid columnWidth={93}>
    <div key="key1"><img src={"tokens/nifties-5-7-7-2.png"} style={niftiesStyle}/></div>
    <div key="key2"><img src={"tokens/nifties-2-6-3-6.png"} style={niftiesStyle}/></div>
    <div key="key3"><img src={"tokens/nifties-5-7-7-2.png"} style={niftiesStyle}/></div>
    <div key="key4"><img src={"tokens/nifties-2-6-3-6.png"} style={niftiesStyle}/></div>
    <div key="key5"><img src={"tokens/nifties-5-7-7-2.png"} style={niftiesStyle}/></div>
    <div key="key6"><img src={"tokens/nifties-2-6-3-6.png"} style={niftiesStyle}/></div>
    <div key="key7"><img src={"tokens/nifties-5-7-7-2.png"} style={niftiesStyle}/></div>
    <div key="key8"><img src={"tokens/nifties-2-6-3-6.png"} style={niftiesStyle}/></div>
  </StackGrid>
</div>
```

Man, this is looking really good!

![gridscale.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/master/public/gridscale.gif)

Next, when they click the "Feed" button it will eventually make a transaction, but for now I want it to open up an Inventory to show the player what monsters they have collected so far. I'll be using the **react-motion** NPM to make this look good.

```
npm install --save react-motion
```

```
<Motion
      defaultStyle={{
        openAmount:0
      }}
      style={{
        openAmount:spring(this.state.openInventory,{ stiffness: 80, damping: 8 })
      }}
      >
      {currentStyles => {
        return (
          <div style={{position:"relative",overflow:"hidden",width:"100%",backgroundImage:"url('grad1.png')", backgroundRepeat:"repeat-x",height:currentStyles.openAmount,borderBottom:"3px solid #444444",borderTop:"1px solid #444444"}}>
            <Scaler config={{origin:"right 50px",adjustedZoom:1.2}}>
              <img src="twitterbutton.png" style={{maxWidth:150,margin:10,float:'right',marginRight:15,cursor:"pointer"}}/>
            </Scaler>
            <div style={{position:"absolute",left:20,top:-15}}><img src={"tokens/nifties-2-7-3-4.png"} style={{maxHeight:160}}/></div>
            <div style={{position:"absolute",left:90,top:-15}}><img src={"tokens/nifties-5-3-6-3.png"} style={{maxHeight:160}}/></div>
            <div style={{position:"absolute",left:160,top:-15}}><img src={"tokens/nifties-2-4-7-1.png"} style={{maxHeight:160}}/></div>
            <div style={{position:"absolute",left:230,top:-15}}><img src={"tokens/nifties-1-5-4-2.png"} style={{maxHeight:160}}/></div>
          </div>
        )
      }}
</Motion>
```

Since the original Nifties vs Nfties debate was just a Twitter back-and-forth, @mattgcondon suggested that I have a button that will let you post your vote/inventory to Twitter. I *really* like how the Twitter button turned out when I drew it to fit the same theme.


![inventory.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austintgriffith/nifties-vs-nfties/master/public/inventory.gif)
