# nifties-vs-nfties - NIFTY remote hack

*Should we call ERC-721 tokens Nifties or Nfties? You decide by crafting monsters with or without eyes.*

I'm not able to attend the [NIFTY hackathon in Hong Kong](https://www.nifty.gg/), but I love to #BUIDL with NFTs so I decided to take the day off work to make a fun little project based around this poll about üëÅÔ∏è's in Nifties:

Other than the rule about physically being there, I will follow all of their [hackathon rules posted here](https://niftyhacks.devpost.com/rules) and do my best to document my process.
